# Capstone Group 18 â€“ Meeting Notes

## September 22, 2025
1. Discussed system architecture and overall structure.
2. Decided to use Electron for the front-end interface.
3. Will use Draw.io to create flowcharts and UML diagrams.
4. Question raised: Should the system run as an online/web-based tool or stay local?

## October 1, 2025
1. Completed the initial Data Flow Diagram (DFD).
**Next steps / Fixes needed:**
1. Create and refine Level 0 DFD.
2. Investigate where a cache system should be implemented.
3. Consider whether developing a consultation module/software is within project scope.
**Noted DFD Issues:**
1. 1.0 File Selection appears twice.
2. 5.0 Static Website Generation incorrectly loops to a new user instead of the original user.

## October 8, 2025
**TA Clarification Needed:**
Do we actually need to use a Database, or can we operate without one given project requirements?

## October 16, 2025
1. Confirmed project direction and next implementation steps.
2. Agreed to begin with a CLI prototype to validate the core system workflow.
3. Plan to test and refine the CLI version before expanding with more advanced features.
**Added a technical enhancement consideration:**
1. Implement OS-specific metadata extraction, using Linux/macOS system calls when applicable and Windows-specific functions where necessary.
2. Reviewed Milestone structure and began outlining task distribution to ensure consistent weekly progress.
3. Decided to meet in person during Monday class sessions to work collaboratively.
**Agreed to:**
1. Create GitHub issues for every task.
2. Link branches and pull requests to their corresponding issues for traceability and clean workflow.
3. (Optional) Prepare a mapping document that links each GitHub issue to a specific project requirement for clarity during evaluation/demonstrations.
