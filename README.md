Please use a branching workflow, and once an item is ready, do remember to issue a PR, review, and merge it into the master branch.
Be sure to keep your docs and README.md up-to-date.


# Branches 

There are three sub-branches (off of main) in this project:
1. [develop](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/tree/develop) — Branch off of here when developing features / making changes to the codebase
2. [doc](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/tree/doc) — All documentation should be located here (e.g. system architecture, project plan)
3. [log](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/tree/log) — All weekly personal logs and the team's log are located here.
