## Proposal

The full proposal can be found here: [Proposal](project-plan/project-plan.md).

## Design Documents

The following system design documents can be found here:
- [System Architecture](design/sys_architecture.png) has been changed to reflect the consolidated class requirements. The dashboard section has been removed as the project now utilizes a CLI. The communication between the back and frontend has also been removed as the project only uses python through the CLI.
- [Updated Level 0 DFD](design/data-flow-diagrams/Milestone1/Group-18-Milestone1-Level0-DFD.jpg) has also been updated without the dashboard included as returned data. Additionally, error message have importantly been included to reflect the requirements.
- [Updated Level 1 DFD](design/data-flow-diagrams/Milestone1/Group18-Milestone1-Level1DFD.jpg) has been updated to include a centralized database which stores user preferences, configurations and past project labels. Additionally, the reporting stage has been generalized into 5.0: Master Project Report and there is no longer the dashboard or website generation option.
