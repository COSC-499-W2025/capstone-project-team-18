    Given the path to the directory where the zip file was extracted,
    discover the projects and their files.

    The way we do this is:
    1. Look at each top-level directory (ignore files at the top level)
    2. For each top-level directory, check if it is a project using heuristics
         (see dir_is_project function).
    3. If it is a project, add it to the list of projects.
    4. If it is not a project, look at its subdirectories and repeat step 2-4.

    The assumption here is that projects are always in their own directories.
