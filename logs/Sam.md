This week, I focused heavily on developing the system architecture and refining the project proposal. We initially had a very basic architecture, but after seeing what other groups had created in class, we decided to go more in-depth. So, I created a new architecture incorporating aspects we observed during class. Additionally, I drafted many of the functional requirements and test cases for the project proposal and outlined the project scope, and usage scenarios.

# Recap on your week's goals
For this week, the goal was figuring out a large, 5,000 foot, overview of what the project would look like and creating the requirements file. Specifically, I help create some non functional requirements and formulaize everyone's expectations of each other for the team contract.
