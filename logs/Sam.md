This week our group need to complete the DFD diagram. Jimi completed the inital diagram and I provided feedback on that first draft. During class, I met with other teams and analyzed their DFD's and participated in group discussions about how we could improve our diagram. Lastly, because other group members helped with the editing of the DFD, I did independent research about metadata and our tech stack for future planning and coding.

This week, I focused heavily on developing the system architecture and refining the project proposal. We initially had a very basic architecture, but after seeing what other groups had created in class, we decided to go more in-depth. So, I created a new architecture incorporating aspects we observed during class. Additionally, I drafted many of the functional requirements and test cases for the project proposal and outlined the project scope, and usage scenarios.

# Recap on your week's goals
For this week, the goal was figuring out a large, 5,000 foot, overview of what the project would look like and creating the requirements file. Specifically, I help create some non functional requirements and formulaize everyone's expectations of each other for the team contract.
