### Recap
For this week, the focus was on developing a high-level overview of our project and finalizing the requirements document. I contributed by helping to specify both the functional and non-functional requirements, making sure that new ideas were placed under the correct sections and that everything flowed clearly. I also worked on refining the wording so the document would read more professionally and consistently.

### Recap
This week I focused on reviewing and refining our system architecture. I compared our design with other teams, identified strengths and weaknesses, and contributed to improving the overall clarity. Additionally, I worked with my teammates in meetings to flesh out the proposal and architecture diagram, and helped brainstorm different approaches to make our project stand out.
