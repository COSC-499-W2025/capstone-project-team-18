### Recap
For this week, the focus was on developing a high-level overview of our project and finalizing the requirements document. I contributed by helping to specify both the functional and non-functional requirements, making sure that new ideas were placed under the correct sections and that everything flowed clearly. I also worked on refining the wording so the document would read more professionally and consistently.

### Recap
This week I focused on reviewing and refining our system architecture. I compared our design with other teams, identified strengths and weaknesses, and contributed to improving the overall clarity. Additionally, I worked with my teammates in meetings to flesh out the proposal and architecture diagram, and helped brainstorm different approaches to make our project stand out.

### Recap
This week, I worked with Jimi to finalize our DFD and ensure the data flow accurately represented our system’s processes. He started the DFD and after feedback from the group and I refined both the Level 0 and Level 1 diagrams for clarity and consistency. I also contributed to general group discussions and adjustments to improve how our diagrams aligned with our system’s functionality.

### Recap
With the new requirements for Milestone #1, our team needed to adjust parts of our project design. I worked closely with Alex to update our Level 0 and Level 1 DFDs to reflect the new system structure that he and Sam developed. Throughout the process, I made edits to ensure the diagrams accurately represented the revised data flow and clarified a few points about how the new design would integrate with our existing components. I also participated in team discussions to review the updated architecture and confirm that everyone was aligned before submission.

### Recap
This week I focused on adding cli functionality and comprehensive testing for the cli. Working primarily with Alex, I contributed to developing the cancel/back navigation feature for the command-line interface, which allows users to return to the main menu from any input prompt. I helped design and implement the `_handle_cancel_input()` helper method that provides consistent cancel handling across all CLI functions, ensuring users can type 'back' or 'cancel' from permissions, filepath, or any other screen.

Additionally, I worked extensively on creating comprehensive test coverage for the CLI functionality. I developed over 20 test cases in `test_app_cli.py` that cover initialization, command routing, user interactions, error handling, and complete workflow integration. The tests use mock-based approaches to simulate user input and verify CLI responses, including edge cases like whitespace handling and invalid commands.

To support these technical implementations, I contributed to updating the CLI documentation with a complete user guide that includes command reference tables, step-by-step workflows, and troubleshooting sections. This week's work directly addresses issues #38 (CLI cancel command) and #41 (CLI test cases), combining them into a cohesive feature update that  improves the user experience and code reliability of our CLI component.

I also reviewed PR's [37](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/pull/37), which was the inital CLI tool creation.
