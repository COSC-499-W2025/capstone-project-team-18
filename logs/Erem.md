### Recap
For this week, the focus was on developing a high-level overview of our project and finalizing the requirements document. I contributed by helping to specify both the functional and non-functional requirements, making sure that new ideas were placed under the correct sections and that everything flowed clearly. I also worked on refining the wording so the document would read more professionally and consistently.

### Recap
This week I focused on reviewing and refining our system architecture. I compared our design with other teams, identified strengths and weaknesses, and contributed to improving the overall clarity. Additionally, I worked with my teammates in meetings to flesh out the proposal and architecture diagram, and helped brainstorm different approaches to make our project stand out.

### Recap
This week, I worked with Jimi to finalize our DFD and ensure the data flow accurately represented our system’s processes. He started the DFD and after feedback from the group and I refined both the Level 0 and Level 1 diagrams for clarity and consistency. I also contributed to general group discussions and adjustments to improve how our diagrams aligned with our system’s functionality.

### Recap
With the new requirements for Milestone #1, our team needed to adjust parts of our project design. I worked closely with Alex to update our Level 0 and Level 1 DFDs to reflect the new system structure that he and Sam developed. Throughout the process, I made edits to ensure the diagrams accurately represented the revised data flow and clarified a few points about how the new design would integrate with our existing components. I also participated in team discussions to review the updated architecture and confirm that everyone was aligned before submission.
