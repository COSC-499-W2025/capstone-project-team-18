# Recap on your week goals
This week, the main focus was on refining the system architecture diagram and completing the project proposal plan. I helped identify areas for improvement in our architecture diagram after meeting with other groups in the class. For the proposal, I created detailed use case diagrams for viewing the results dashboard and generating a static webpage with the option to host it on GitHub Pages.
