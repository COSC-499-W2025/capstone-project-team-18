# Recap on your week goals
This week, my focus was on organizing our documentation to support ongoing project tracking. I created a minutes/ directory, uploaded all past meeting notes, and took the notes for our October 16 session to maintain a consistent record of project progress. This centralizes our communication history and sets a clear structure for future documentation. In addition, I participated in our team meeting to discuss upcoming priorities and spent time reviewing my teammatesâ€™ code to provide feedback.
