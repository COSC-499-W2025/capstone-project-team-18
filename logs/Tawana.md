# Recap on your week goals
This week, my focus was on implementing a key feature for user-level reporting within our statistics system. I worked on Issue #71: Display a Friendly Representation of UserReport Class, adding a method in the UserReport class to convert stored statistics into readable user-facing messages, along with a full supporting test suite to ensure correct formatting and behavior.

I also reviewed and tested Issue #40: Add File Metadata to FileReport and Issue #68: Generate File Reports After Project Extraction, to help ensure quality and consistency across our codebase.

# Recap on your week goals
This week, my focus was on organizing our documentation to support ongoing project tracking. I created a minutes/ directory, uploaded all past meeting notes, and took the notes for our October 16 session to maintain a consistent record of project progress. This centralizes our communication history and sets a clear structure for future documentation. In addition, I participated in our team meeting to discuss upcoming priorities and spent time reviewing my teammatesâ€™ code to provide feedback.
