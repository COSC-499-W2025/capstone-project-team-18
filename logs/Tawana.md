# Recap on your week goals
This week, my focus was on expanding our analyzer framework to support web development files by implementing CSS, HTML, and PHP analyzers. I worked on Issue `#142`, adding dedicated analyzers for each file type to detect relevant language-specific elements—such as rule blocks and class selectors in CSS, linked resources and scripts in HTML, and functions, classes, and imports in PHP.

I also updated the factory routing in get_appropriate_analyzer() to ensure correct analyzer selection for these new file types and created a full test suite (test_web_analyzers.py) to validate their functionality. This addition enhances our system’s overall analysis coverage and ensures consistent behavior across all supported languages.

This week, my focus was on implementing a key feature for user-level reporting within our statistics system. I worked on Issue #71: Display a Friendly Representation of UserReport Class, adding a method in the UserReport class to convert stored statistics into readable user-facing messages, along with a full supporting test suite to ensure correct formatting and behavior.

I also reviewed and tested Issue #40: Add File Metadata to FileReport and Issue #68: Generate File Reports After Project Extraction, to help ensure quality and consistency across our codebase.

# Recap on your week goals
This week, my focus was on organizing our documentation to support ongoing project tracking. I created a minutes/ directory, uploaded all past meeting notes, and took the notes for our October 16 session to maintain a consistent record of project progress. This centralizes our communication history and sets a clear structure for future documentation. In addition, I participated in our team meeting to discuss upcoming priorities and spent time reviewing my teammates’ code to provide feedback.

This week, the main focus was on restructuring the documentation and aligning it with the updated Milestone #1 requirements. I contributed by preparing the team log, summarizing our progress, documenting the changes made to the system architecture and DFDs, and ensuring that our updated goals and deliverables were clearly reflected. This helped maintain consistency across the documentation branch and ensured that our work remained aligned with the revised direction.
