### Peer Eval

### Recap
This week's goal was to start laying the foundation for our project by discussing potential technologies/the tech stack we want to use, figuring out what each member's strong suit(s) are, and and overall plan of attack for year.

I personally worked on writing the nonfunctional requirements for our requirements document and researching the viability of using Electron for a cross-platform desktop app.

### Peer Eval

### Recap
My goals for this week were to work with my team to create the system arcitecture, define specific features for the app, and brainstorm ideas for implementation and unique features that would make our app stand out. 

I led our team's brainstorming session and later assigned each person in our team to different parts of the project plan document. My contributions to the document were the proposed solution, the UML use case diagram, some of the use case descriptions, and the tech stack table.

### Recap

With the requirements for Milestone #1 our project needed changes. Sam and I worked together to come up with a new project design that ensured all of these requirements were defined, and reviewed it with the rest of the team to make sure that they agreed/liked the new design. I worked with Erem to update the team's existing level 0 and level 1 DFDs to match the design that Sam and I had come up with. During this process, I was able to clarify/answer the questions that Erem had about the new design. Lastly, I reviewed and approved Sam's PR for the boilerplate class defintions that he created for the project (`analyzer.py`, `report.py`, etc.), and Jimi's personal log for the week.
