### Recap

This week's goals were to finish the requirements and I was assigned to complete the functional requirements and print the sheets before class. Nothing has been added to the project board as of yet as that has been reserved for development.

## Week 4, Sept. 22–28

### Peer Eval

### Recap

This week's goals were to finish the project proposal, system architecture and define our tech stack. My tasks this week were, as usual, completing the team logs. Additionally, I worked within our meetings to flesh out our proposal and system architecture diagram. This included some writing use cases and the requirements section.

## Week 5, Sept. 29 - Oct. 5

### Peer Eval

### Recap

This week's goals were to finish the DFD diagram and understand the data flow of our system. My role was to complete the DFD before the first class. I took feedback from the group and completed the diagram. We then spent the rest of the week adjusting and improving bot the Level 0 & 1 diagrams.

## Week 6, Oct. 6–12

### Peer Eval

### Recap

This week's goals were to rework our documentation to more closely be aligned with the class requirements. I was responsible for consolidating these changes into the README. I also reworked the WBS by changing the requirements to follow the format necessary for a CLI over.

## Week 7, Oct. 13–19

### Peer Eval

### Recap

This week's goals were to flesh out classes for our code and create a baseline for the project. We wanted to build out the initial CLI interface and create parent classes which will act as placeholders for analysis and statistics. My role during this week was to flesh out the issues page and project board such that everyone knew what was available and needed for development. This also allowed us to understand what could be combined into the same features. Additionally, I worked on the logic for fetching metadata based on the user's operating system.

## Week 8, Oct. 20-26

### Peer Eval

### Recap

This week's goals were to create an end-to-end workflow for the artifact miner which made minor assessments about files given a zip file. This would allow us to expand upon this flow, adding complexity and depth. The week started with a monday meeting where we examined requirements, their related dev area and assigned them amongst each other. Then we meet on Wednseday to track our progress again. This week I focused on generating FileReports for a project. This acted as a bridge for the other methods being worked on. Additionally, I fleshed out the issues page, project board and merged and tested my team's PRs.
