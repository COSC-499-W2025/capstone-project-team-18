### Recap

This week's goals were to finish the project proposal, system architecture and define our tech stack. My tasks this week were, as usual, completing the team logs. Additionally, I worked within our meetings to flesh out our proposal and system architecture diagram. This included some writing use cases and the requirements section.

### Recap

This week's goals were to finish the DFD diagram and understand the data flow of our system. My role was to complete the DFD before the first class. I took feedback from the group and completed the diagram. We then spent the rest of the week adjusting and improving bot the Level 0 & 1 diagrams.
