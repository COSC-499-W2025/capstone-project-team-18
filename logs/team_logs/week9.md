# Team 18 — Week 9, Oct. 27 - Nov. 2

## Overview

### Milestone Goals
- This week we focused on expanding the end-to-end workflow we had built last week. We created issues and worked on things that would help develop our system to get more specifc information and a wider range of statistics given a .ZIP file. This included project discovery, project and file analyzers, database refinement, and statistic reporting.

    **Specifically**:
    - Improved upon Git-tracked project functionality (meaning analyzing and extrapolating individual commit)
        -  [Issue #78](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/78)
    - File type detection for FileReports (ensure files follow correct path from parent -> child)
        - [Issue #61](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/61)
    - Project Level Aggregate Statistics (compile stats from each FielReport and complete additional analysis)
        - [Issue #130](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/130)
    - Analyzers for various langauges (CSS, PHP, HTML, C, TypeScript)
        - [Issue #122](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/122) and
        [Issue #142](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/142)
    - Create Resume class for future output of generated statistics
        - [Issue #127](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/127)
    - Dynamic Column Generation for Database
        - [Issue #128](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/128)
    - Error handling for incorrect filepathing
        - [Issue #133](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/133)
    - End-to-End Workflow (Project works from the CLI !)
        - [Issue #120](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/120)
    - Updated Empty Project Behaviour
        - [Issue #109](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/109)
    - Add additonal statistics for natural langauge
        - [Issue #113](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/113) and
        [Issue #112](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-18/issues/112)
