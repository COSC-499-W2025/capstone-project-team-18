# Team 18 â€” Week 4, Sept. 22-28

## Overview

### Milestone Goals

This week the goals were to complete the system architecture diagram, project proposal and flesh out the tech stack we plan to implement. This included defining use cases, test cases, functional and no-functional requirements as well as project scope. The tech stack has now been defined as a Electron framework which uses the React library for the frontend, a Node.js backend and Jest for our testing framework.
