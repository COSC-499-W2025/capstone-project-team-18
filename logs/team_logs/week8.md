# Team 18 â€” Week 8, Oct 19-26

## Overview

### Milestone Goals

This week we focused on coding up an end to end workflow. We created issues and worked on things that would help develop our system to get from filepath to information on the terminal. This inculded project discovery, project and file analyzers, database setup, and statistic reporting.

Specifcally, we worked on the following Milestone #1 requirements with the followings tasks:
- Parse a specified zipped folder containing nested folders and files.
    - Inital logic for this was completed with #67.
- Distinguish individual projects from collaborative projects.
    - Logic for this was completed with #67.
- For a coding project, identify the programming language and framework used.
    - Programming language specific logic was created with #90 and #88
- Extract key contribution metrics in a project, displaying information about the duration of the project and activity type contribution frequency (e.g., code vs test vs design vs document), and other important information.
    - This was worked on with tasks #90, #88, #69
- Output all the key information for a project
    - This was worked on with task #91
- Store project information into a database
    - Inital database setup was created with #96
