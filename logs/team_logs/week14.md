# Team 18 — Week 14, Nov. 30 – Dec. 07

## Overview

### Milestone 1 Work:
This week focused on completing and stabilizing all remaining Milestone 1 requirements. With feature work finished, most contributions involved final debugging, code maintenance, resolving edge-case failures, consolidating statistics into the new framework, improving CLI flows, and preparing the repository for the demo. In addition to code changes, we finalized the Milestone 1 Presentation for Wed Dec 3rd, produced the Milestone 1 Demo Video, and completed the Milestone 1 README documentation, ensuring all required deliverables were packaged and ready for submission. Several quality-of-life fixes were also completed, ensuring the system behaves consistently across portfolio, résumé, and project report operations.
