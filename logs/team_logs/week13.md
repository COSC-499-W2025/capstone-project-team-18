# Team 18 — Week 13, Nov. 24-30

## Overview

### Milestone Goals

We worked hard to finish up the milestone requirements. We are in a good place, all requirements are now met or have a PR open, we just have more work to refine these requirements.

We worked on the following milestone goals this week:
10. Extract key contribution metrics in a project activity type contribution frequency (e.g., code vs test vs design vs document),
14. Retrieve previously generated portfolio information
15. Retrieve previously generated résumé item
17. Summarize the top ranked projects
18. Delete previously generated insights and ensure files that are shared across multiple reports do not get affected
