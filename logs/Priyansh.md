### Recap  
This week's goal was to start laying the foundation for our project by discussing potential technologies/the tech stack we want to use, figuring out what each member's strong suits are, and building an overall plan for the year.  

I personally helped by contributing to both the **functional** and **nonfunctional requirements** sections of our requirements document.

### Recap  
My goals for this week were to work on the **use cases**

 My contributions included drafting detailed descriptions of user interactions like running an analysis job, viewing results in a dashboard, and handling cases such as missing metadata or long-running processes. These use cases helped clarify expected system behaviors and were tied directly to requirements and test cases in the project plan.
