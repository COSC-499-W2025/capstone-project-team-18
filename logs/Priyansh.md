### Recap  
This week's goal was to start laying the foundation for our project by discussing potential technologies/the tech stack we want to use, figuring out what each member's strong suits are, and building an overall plan for the year.  

I personally helped by contributing to both the **functional** and **nonfunctional requirements** sections of our requirements document.

### Recap  
My goals for this week were to work on the **use cases**.  

My contributions included drafting detailed descriptions of user interactions like running an analysis job, viewing results in a dashboard, and handling cases such as missing metadata or long-running processes. These use cases helped clarify expected system behaviors and were tied directly to requirements and test cases in the project plan.

### Recap  
This weekâ€™s goals were to begin visualizing the data flow of our system and produce the first draft of the Level 0 and Level 1 Data Flow Diagram.  
My role was to design and complete the initial version of the Level 0 DFD. I focused on identifying the main processes, data stores, and external entities involved in the system.  
After finishing the draft, I shared it with the group to gather their feedback. We discussed several improvements, including data labeling and flow, which helped me refine the next version of the Level 0 diagram.
