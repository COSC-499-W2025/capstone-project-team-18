### Recap
This week's goal was to start laying the foundation for our project by discussing potential technologies/the tech stack we want to use, figuring out what each member's strong suits are, and building an overall plan for the year.

I personally helped by contributing to both the **functional** and **nonfunctional requirements** sections of our requirements document.

### Recap
My goals for this week were to work on the **use cases**.

My contributions included drafting detailed descriptions of user interactions like running an analysis job, viewing results in a dashboard, and handling cases such as missing metadata or long-running processes. These use cases helped clarify expected system behaviors and were tied directly to requirements and test cases in the project plan.

### Recap
This weekâ€™s goals were to begin visualizing the data flow of our system and produce the first draft of the Level 0 and Level 1 Data Flow Diagram.
My role was to design and complete the initial version of the Level 0 DFD. I focused on identifying the main processes, data stores, and external entities involved in the system.
After finishing the draft, I shared it with the group to gather their feedback. We discussed several improvements, including data labeling and flow, which helped me refine the next version of the Level 0 diagram.


## Week 6, Oct. 6 - Oct.12

### Peer Eval

### Recap
This week's goals focused on aligning our project design with Milestone #1 requirements and contributing to documentation reviews.

I collaborated with my team to discuss ideas for modifying our existing design plans to better match the requirements for Milestone #1. These discussions helped us refine our approach to the data flow diagrams and overall system architecture.

Additionally, I reviewed and approved several pull requests to ensure quality and completeness of our team's work. I reviewed Erem's PR , which contained the finalized Milestone 1 DFD Level 0 & 1 diagrams that consolidated our data flow visualization work. I also reviewed Jimi's PR, examining the updated documentation to verify that all use cases, diagrams, and requirements were complete and clearly defined. Lastly, I reviewed Alex's personal and team logs for Week 6, confirming they accurately reflected the week's accomplishments and progress toward Milestone #1.
